      <p className="text-[14px] lg:text-[18px]">
        I'm a passionate MERN stack developer with a strong foundation in
        building full-stack web applications. I began learning in 2020, and for
        the past couple of years, I've been confidently writing clean, efficient
        code and creating meaningful user experiences. I enjoy solving problems,
        continuously improving my skills, and collaborating with others to bring
        ideas to life through code.
